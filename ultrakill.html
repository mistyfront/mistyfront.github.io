	  <h2>Let me preface this by saying I have never been the biggest fan of first-person shooter games.</h2>
	  
	  <p>Over my years of playing, I've only really been enamored with three: Half-Life 2, Titanfall 2, and DOOM (2016). Half-Life 2 was my first ever experience with an FPS campaign--I can still remember my mind being blown by it in 2015. Among all the things that the game does really well, one thing really stood out to me: the goddamn shotgun. Something about using it was just so satisfying. I was constantly running out of ammo for it and had to scrounge around for the refills scattered throughout the levels--I think that's a mark of true love for a weapon. I was going to write something more profound here but it truly is the thing I remember most about HL-2.</p>
	  
	  <p>Continuing this trend, I loved the <em>fully-automatic shotgun</em> in Titanfall 2. In video games where swords aren't an option, I find I tend to gravitate towards shotguns the most. I found a special version of one early on that, mercifully, had an expanded ammo capacity. With that, I basically had one free weapon slot (of two) the entire game, and I religiously avoided swapping out the shotgun lest I lose it forever. It was at my side as I slid and wallran through every level--movement in that game was paramount. So much so that despite my enjoyment of Mirror's Edge, I spent my entire playthrough wishing I was moving like I could in Titanfall 2. No other AAA game has come remotely close to topping TF|2's movement, and maybe I'd like AAA FPS games more if EA didn't fuck up and it got the success it deserved. Anyways.</p>
	  
	  <p>DOOM (2016) was a game I had to give a second chance. The first time I played it I thought 'haha funny rip and tear game' and put it down after about an hour. About a year and a half later, I was really starved for games to play and decided that I was going to make it all the way through this time. I liked it a lot more than I was expecting to--once again largely in part to kickass shotgun(s). However--If I say I didn't play it solely for the music I'd be lying. I don't even want to think about playing that game on mute. Mick Gordon's hyperviolent soundtrack ensures that there's never a dull moment throughout the campaign. 
	  
	  <p>From these three examples, we can clearly see what I value in FPS games: satisfying weapons, heart-pumping music, and slick movement. These three things create a sense of style and truly elevate the overall experience of a game.</p>
	  
	  
	  
	  <h2>INTO THE FIRE [[overview]]</h2>
	  
	  <p>Enter ULTRAKILL. The game where you can punch your own shotgun pellets to make them go faster and <em>explode on impact.</em> The game where you can bounce a railcannon shot between three coins you tossed in the air to eviscerate a single enemy. The game where you can bounce <em>enemy</em> lasers off said coins. This shit is a science. If you have a question about what you can do with weapons in this game, the answer is almost always yes. Eventually you reach critical mass of "wouldn't it be funny if" and transcend to a higher plane of stylish existence.</p>
	  
	  <p>Despite your relative fragility, getting back into the fray after taking a hit is surprisingly simple: steal blood from enemies. The game tells you that <strong style="font-family: 'vcrosd'">THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO HEAL</strong> at the very beginning. The concept is simple, but in practice it can be quite complicated. You have to be very close to an enemy as they take damage to heal--this may involve hedging bets against oblivion as you dance through a horde of enemies with less than a quarter of your health. Similarly to Bloodborne, you are rewarded for playing aggressively and taking risks.
	  
	  
	  <h2>ADRENALINE [[the fucking music!]]</h2>
	  
	  
	  <h2>DANTE'S INFERNO [[story and lore]]</h2>
	  <p>The nine words printed in blood red at the start of the game tell you everything you need to know:  <strong style="font-family: 'vcrosd'; color: #FE0000">MANKIND IS DEAD. BLOOD IS FUEL. HELL IS FULL.</strong> You play as a robot named V1 rapidly approaching Hell through the shafts of an abandoned mining facility, tearing through all the husks and demons that stand in its way.</p>
	  
	  <p>I really enjoy the way the lore is presented in this game. The vast majority of written text in the game is contained in a little yellow arcade machine that plays a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI2u6mSd62s" target="_blank">jolly 1930s song</a> while active--it appears at the start of every level after completing the first. While interacting with the terminal, V1 actually taps the screen in-game (which is suprisingly entertaining). Through this, you can unlock new weapon variants and reorder your loadout. You can also read tips about dealing with enemies you've previously encountered. This is where the lore lies, masterfully woven into actually helpful advice.
	  
	  
<!-- I'm leaving this here because I think it's funny
      <p>A grilled cheese consists of only these following items. Cheese. Bread with spread (usually butter). This entire subreddit consist of "melts". Almost every "grilled cheese" sandwich i see on here has other items added to it. The fact that this subreddit is called "grilledcheese" is nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have nothing against melts, I just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses. Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? It's called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I don't know what the hell you'd call that but it's not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to wager I've eaten more grilled cheeses in my 21 years than any of you had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread. But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled "melts" because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. I'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac & cheese. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. Shit, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I've seen post after post of peoples "grilled cheeses" all over reddit and it's been driving me insane. The moment i saw this subreddit this morning I finally snapped. Hell, I may even start my own subreddit just because I know this one exists now.</p>
      <p>You god damn heretics. Respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into whatever you like and love it for it what it is. Or make your damn melt sandwich and call it for what it is. A melt.</p>

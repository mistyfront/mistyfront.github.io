	  <h2>MANKIND IS DEAD. BLOOD IS FUEL. HELL IS FULL.</h2>
	  
	  <p>Let me preface this by saying I have never been the biggest fan of first-person shooter games. Over my years of playing, I've only really been enamored with three: Half-Life 2, Titanfall 2, and DOOM (2016). Half-Life 2 was my first ever experience with an FPS campaign--I can still remember my mind being blown by it in 2015. Among all the things that the game does really well, one thing really stood out to me: the goddamn shotgun. Something about using it was just so satisfying. I was constantly running out of ammo for it and had to scrounge around for the refills scattered throughout the levels--I think that's a mark of true love for a weapon. I was going to write something more profound here but it truly is the thing I remember most about HL-2.</p>
	  
	  <p>Continuing this trend, I loved the <em>fully-automatic shogtun</em> in Titanfall 2. That thing kicked like a mule with its balls wrapped in duct tape. I found a special version of one early on that, mercifully, had an expanded ammo capacity. With that, I basically had one weapon slot the entire game. I religiously avoided swapping it out lest it be lost forever. The EVA-8 is not the only thing I remember fondly about Titanfall 2, though. The movement in that game was transcendent. It was so incredible to the point where I was constantly thinking "this is cool, but I really wish I was playing Titanfall 2 right now" during my entire playthrough of Mirror's Edge (still a wonderful game, though). No other AAA game has come remotely close to topping TF|2's movement, and maybe I'd like AAA FPS games more if EA didn't fuck up and it got the success it deserved. Anyways.</p>
	  
	  <p>DOOM (2016) was a game I had to give a second chance.

<!-- I'm leaving this here because I think it's funny
      <p>A grilled cheese consists of only these following items. Cheese. Bread with spread (usually butter). This entire subreddit consist of "melts". Almost every "grilled cheese" sandwich i see on here has other items added to it. The fact that this subreddit is called "grilledcheese" is nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have nothing against melts, I just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses. Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? It's called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I don't know what the hell you'd call that but it's not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to wager I've eaten more grilled cheeses in my 21 years than any of you had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread. But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled "melts" because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. I'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac & cheese. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. Shit, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I've seen post after post of peoples "grilled cheeses" all over reddit and it's been driving me insane. The moment i saw this subreddit this morning I finally snapped. Hell, I may even start my own subreddit just because I know this one exists now.</p>
      <p>You god damn heretics. Respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into whatever you like and love it for it what it is. Or make your damn melt sandwich and call it for what it is. A melt.</p>
